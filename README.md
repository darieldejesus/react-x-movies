# React X-Movies

React X - Movies is a simple web app where you can see the details of your favorite movies.

 ### Getting started
 These are the instructions to install and run a copy locally for development and testing purposes.

 #### Pre-Requisites
 - Docker - https://www.docker.com/community-edition

 #### Install

After installing Docker on your local machine, you need to follow the next steps to clone the repository and run the project.

- Let's clone this repository to a local folder:
```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:darieldejesus/react-x-movies.git
$ cd react-x-movies/
```
- Then, let's run the **docker-compose** command:
```sh
$ docker-compose -d
```
This comment will download the images for NodeJS v8 and will automatically install the project dependencies specified in the *package.json* file.
Finally, you can access to the React app through http://localhost:3000/

#### Running the test
In order to run the tests, go to the root of the project and run the following command:
```sh
$ docker-compose exec web yarn test
```
